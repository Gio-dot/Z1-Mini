## [Z1-Mini](https://gio-dot.github.io/Z1-Mini/)/How to flash


Once we have a .hex file, we are ready to flash it to the Z1-Mini. There are 2 way to do so:

1. Using a programmer like CC-Debugger or SmartRF04EB directly connected with 10 pin flat cable to ISP connector of Z1-Mini.
2. Using a Raspberry without any programmer.
